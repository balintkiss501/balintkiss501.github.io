<p><img src="/assets/images/raycaster.gif" alt="" width="100%" /></p>

<p>My take on making a raycasting 3D engine in C++ and SDL2, also with my own tiny
template linear algebra lib. One of the goals was to make raycasting
computation equations more explicit and readable.</p>

<h3 id="balints-dos-game-library"><a href="https://github.com/balintkiss501/BDGL" target="\_blank">Balint’s DOS Game Library</a></h3>

<p>A work-in-progress C library for DOS game programming, currently containing DOS graphics-related functions and has an API reminiscent of SDL. 16-bit programs compiled with a Open Watcom and linked with this library work under DOSBox. The currently supported DOS compiler is Open Watcom 1.9 and Open Watcom V2 on Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>Will I eventually use it to create a real game? Who knows, this was more
like a learning experience to see how games used to be made back in the early
’90s.</p>

<p>It currently features</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />256 color 320x240 VGA mode with optional VSync and Double Buffering<br />
<input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />Drawing of primitives, like points, lines and rectangles<br />
<input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />BMP image support<br />
<input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />Palette manipulation<br />
<input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />Keyboard input handling<br />
<input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="" />Mouse input handling<br /></p>

<h3 id="awesome-dos"><a href="https://github.com/balintkissdev/awesome-dos#readme" target="\_blank">Awesome DOS</a></h3>

<p>A curated list of references for development of DOS applications and learning about the system itself. This includes list of compilers, tutorials, videos, links to free and paid books and source code to DOS games. The goal of this list is to collect information and act as a starting point for someone who wants to start out retro-programming for the DOS platform.</p>

<h3 id="master-thesis-information-retrieval-from-java-archive-format"><a href="https://github.com/balintkiss501/master-thesis" target="\_blank">Master thesis: Information retrieval from Java archive format</a></h3>

<p>This is my master thesis, which deals with the topic of reverse engineering Java
class structures from JAR files. The documentation contains technical background
information and methods on doing that, while describes implementation of a JAR
reader module for <a href="https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeCompass">CodeCompass</a>, a
code comprehension tool maintained by Ericsson.</p>

<p>This reading is useful for anyone who wants to start out with reverse engineering
Java bytecode or anyone who wants an in-depth understanding on how the JVM executes
bytecode programs.</p>
