				<h2>FAQ</h2></header><h2 id="what-is-your-advice-on-learning-c">What is your advice on learning C++?</h2>

<p>I once wrote an answer on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/958imi/fledgling_c_student_looking_for_best_textbooks/e3rimis">Reddit post</a>
about a question like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s hard for me to recommend beginner C++ books, because what I did is transition from a different high-level language (Java) to C++. The usual de facto C++ beginner book that is usually recommended is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Primer-5th-Stanley-B-Lippman/dp/0321714113">C++ Primer</a> (not to be confused with C++ Primer Plus, which is by a different author and is considered inferior). However, I did not finish the whole book, and quickly got bored of it.</p>

  <p>What I did is read the whole <a href="https://isocpp.org/faq">C++ FAQ</a> and then just simply start hacking on simple pet projects like a small HTTP server using Boost.Asio. Then I attended a university course about C++11 and then started reading intermediate books like the Scott Meyers series. Keep in mind, that this approach does not work for everyone.</p>

  <p>My recommendation is this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Start reading and coding along to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tour-2nd-Depth-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832">A Tour of C++</a> by none other than the creator of C++ itself, Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Read the <a href="https://isocpp.org/faq">C++ FAQ</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Practice with your initial knowledge on a side project of yours that you like. You can find ideas here: <a href="https://github.com/karan/Projects">https://github.com/karan/Projects</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>After that, read through Scott Meyer’s Effective C++, More Effective C++, Modern Effective C++ and Effective STL. Congratulations, now you know C++! Not. Because this language has many domains (the C subset, OOP, templates, STL, C++11’s new stuff, etc.) and nobody knows all of them, people usually specialize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I would suggest is learn the basics of C++ first from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tour-2nd-Depth-Bjarne-Stroustrup/dp/0134997832">A Tour of C++</a>,
then read the <a href="https://isocpp.org/faq">C++ FAQ</a>, create small programming projects and read through Scott Meyer’s Effective C++ series.</p>

<p>If you want to see more recommended C++ books, take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list">The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List</a>.</p>

<p>If you come from a different programming language, then these are the concepts that you should get yourself
familiar with first:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Difference between the compiler and linker</li>
  <li>Pointers and references</li>
  <li>Difference between stack and heap memory</li>
  <li>Importance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> references as function parameters from performance and safety viewpoints</li>
  <li>Constructors, destructors, copy constructor and copy assignment operators</li>
  <li>Difference between member initializer list and constructor body from performance viewpoint</li>
</ul>

<p>Final tips while using C++ for the first time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not abuse inheritance chains. Think of the maintanability nightmare of
modifying base classes and learn about the performance overhead of pointer
indirection. Whenever I see people making this mistake I always cite
<a href="https://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/tough-times-on-the-road-to-starcraft">this article about the making of Starcraft</a>
on how the development team struggled with long inheritance chains when they
first started using C++. Prefer composition over inheritance and don’t have more than 1-2 base classes.</li>
  <li>Best way to learn is making a small project. You learn how to structure your files in your project,
see the language in action and
forces you to Google the problems whenever you get into roadblocks.</li>
  <li>The challenge of learning a new language is not about the syntax. It’s about
learning the culture and the paradigms of the language.</li>
